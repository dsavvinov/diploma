1. "Inferring better contracts". Yi Wei, Carlo A. Furia, Nikolay Kazmin, Bertrand Meyer, **2011**
2. "A comparative study of programmer written and automatically inferred contracts". Nadia Polikarpova,
  Linca Ciupa, Bertrand Meyer, **2009**
3. "Inferring Method Effect Summaries for Nested Heap Regions", Mohsen Vakilian,
  Danny Dig, Robert Bocchino, Jeffrey Overbey, Vikram Adve, Ralph Johnson.
  Seems not very useful but provides tons of links.
4. "Polymorphic effects system". Lucassen, Gifford, 1988.
5. "An Object-Oriented Effects System". Greenhouse, Boyland. 1999
6. "Type and Effect Systems". Nielson, Nielson.
   **Tons of links**.
7. Report on the FX Programming Language -- functional programming lanugage that incorporates effect system.
8. "Alias Killing: Unique Variables Without Destructive Reads". John Boyland.
9. Landi, Ryder. "Pointer-induced Aliasing: A Problem Classification" - pointer-aliasing is NP-hard.
  Understanding that pointer-aliasing is NP-hard is hard too.
10. "Separate Abstract Interpretation for Control-Flow Analysis". Yan Mei Tang, Pierre Jouvelot, 1994. -
  how to collect all functions that may be called by the particular call.
11. "Types for Atomicity: Static Checking and Inference for Java". Flanagan, Freund, Lifshin. **2008**. - about data races and concurrency.
12. "MJ: An imperative core calculus for Java and Java with effects". Bierman, Prakinson, Pitts. 2003 - formalization of some (significant) part of Java + simple read-write effect system.
13. "SafeJava: A unified type system fot safe programming". Chandrasekhar Boyapati, 1998. 160 pages-long thesis, constructs some extension of Java that incrorporate a lot of type safety and checks. From effects POV, only read-write effects and immutability are considered (immutability is interesting though)
